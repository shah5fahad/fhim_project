                            Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infection (CAUTI) is one of the most prevalent and preventable healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), posing a serious challenge to patient safety worldwide. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) linked to indwelling catheter use account for approximately 40% of all hospital-acquired infections. The risk of developing CAUTI increases significantly with the duration of catheterization, improper insertion techniques, lack of hand hygiene, and non-compliance with catheter care protocols.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of a structured teaching program on CAUTI prevention among staff nurses at NMCH. The research approach was descriptive, using a one-group design with 60 staff nurses who provide care to indwelling catheter patients. Data was collected through surveys and analyzed with descriptive and inferential statistics.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Results showed significant improvement in knowledge levels: pre-test results indicated 37% had poor knowledge, 50% had fair knowledge, and only 13.3% had good knowledge. After the structured teaching program, only 10% had poor knowledge, 20% had fair knowledge, and 70% demonstrated good knowledge. The overall mean knowledge score improved to 82.73% with an SD of 5.10%.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The study concludes that structured teaching programs significantly enhance nurses' knowledge and awareness of CAUTI prevention, emphasizing the importance of hand hygiene, aseptic catheter insertion, and strict compliance with care protocols. Continuous education and training interventions are essential to strengthen infection control practices and minimize healthcare-associated infections in clinical settings.
