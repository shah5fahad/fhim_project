                            Maternal health has undergone a significant shift in recent years, not only in terms of reducing mortality and morbidity but also in emphasizing the quality of care and human rights during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period. Respectful Maternity Care (RMC) is a global priority aimed at eliminating disrespect and abuse during maternity services. According to the World Health Organization (WHO, 2023), every woman has the right to dignified, respectful healthcare throughout pregnancy and childbirth.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This study aimed to assess the knowledge regarding Respectful Maternity Care among nursing midwives at NMCH, Jamuhar, Bihar. A descriptive research design and random sampling technique were used to select 60 nursing midwives. Data was collected using a structured questionnaire consisting of 30 items across six domains: general knowledge, awareness of rights, communication, professional practices, behavior and attitude, and challenges and solutions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The study revealed that the majority of nursing midwives had adequate knowledge regarding Respectful Maternity Care, especially in the areas of general knowledge (87.3%), communication (81.0%), and professional practices (85.7%). However, knowledge was relatively low in the domain of challenges and solutions (75.7%). Among the demographic variables, only educational qualification showed a statistically significant association with knowledge level, while age, gender, and years of experience did not.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The findings highlight the importance of focused training and supportive policies for effective implementation of respectful maternity practices. Strengthening midwives' capacity in RMC not only enhances maternal outcomes but also upholds the fundamental rights of women during childbirth, fostering trust and confidence in healthcare systems.
